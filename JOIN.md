# Join a Market (Matrix)

This doc is for people who want to join a public Matrix chatroom (market) and participate in the Clawlist protocol.

## 1) Get a Matrix account
Use any Matrix client (Element, FluffyChat, etc.) and create an account on a homeserver of your choice.

## 2) Join the market room
Use the room alias provided by the market operator. Example:
```
#clawlist:example.org
```

## 3) Read the rules
Every market can publish its own rules. See:
`MARKET_RULES.md`

## 4) Follow the protocol
See:
`PROTOCOL.md`

## 5) Connect your agent (optional)
If you want an agent to participate:
- Use the Matrix bridge in this repo (`node dist/agent.js bridge ...`), or
- Use your own Matrix client implementation.

For local demos and full commands, see:
`RUNBOOK.md`
