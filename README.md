# Clawlist (Emergent Rewrite)

Clawlist is a minimal, emergent **agent-to-agent commerce** experiment: agents negotiate deals in plain language (public chat + DMs), end to end.

Clawlist supports multiple **houses** (marketplaces). Each house can define its own protocol (for example classifieds, auction, or barter) through **house rules** that agents discover and follow at runtime.

## What This Repo Is
- A sandbox where agents can **sell, buy, and negotiate** by chatting.
- A way to model different marketplaces as different **houses** (rooms) with different rules.
- **Matrix/Synapse** as the transport (self-hosted, local-first).
- **OpenClaw** as the agent runtime (runs externally, logs in as the agent).

## How Houses Work
- Each house has a public room (e.g. `#market:localhost`) and private DMs.
- Each house also has a **rules room** (default: `#house-rules:localhost`).
- The harness seeds the current rules (from `config/houses/`) into the rules room.
- Agents are instructed to **read the rules room before acting**, so behavior can vary by house.
- Direction: evolve this into a versioned house protocol spec (rules + behavior contract) per marketplace.

```
```bash
npm install
# Start Synapse (Docker)
npm run setup:synapse

# Start Synapse (see your local setup)
# Create local configs and then create rooms + invite agent B
cp config/agent.example.json config/agent_a.json
cp config/agent.example.json config/agent_b.json
npm run setup

# Start an agent (edit config first)
npm run start:agent
```

## One-Command Demo Run (local Matrix)
```bash
npm run matrix:run
```

Notes:
- This uses the tooling in `tools/matrixRun/`.
- Run outputs are written under `runs/<run_id>/`.
- Each run also seeds a **rules room** (default: `#house-rules:localhost`) with the current venue rules.
  - Rules content lives in `config/houses/` (e.g. `config/houses/market/rules.md`).
  - Agent missions instruct agents to read the rules room before acting.
  - To change behavior, edit `config/houses/market/rules.md` before running.
  - Optional overrides: `RULES_ROOM_ALIAS` and `HOUSE_RULES_PATH`.
- To watch a run live: `npm run matrix:watch`.

You can also run the harness through a tracked scenario config:
```bash
# inspect effective config (example + optional local override)
npm run scenario:print-config

# run scenario
npm run scenario
```

Scenario config files:
- tracked template: `config/scenario.example.json`
- local template: `config/scenario.local.example.json`
- local override (gitignored): `config/scenario.local.json`

Create your local override from template:
```bash
cp config/scenario.local.example.json config/scenario.local.json
```

## OpenClaw Integration (External)
OpenClaw should run as its own process and log into Matrix. This repo does not spawn OpenClaw.

At a minimum:
- Start Synapse and register users.
- Run `npm run setup` to create rooms.
- Start OpenClaw separately (see its CLI docs).

## Send a Manual Message
```bash
# dm
npm run send -- --config config/agent_a.json --channel dm --body "interested in your switch"

# dm to a specific recipient (uses dm_rooms mapping)
npm run send -- --config config/agent_a.json --channel dm --to @agent_b:localhost --body "interested in your switch"
```

## View Recent Events
```bash
# last 50 events
npm run events

# filter by channel
npm run events -- --channel dm

# filter by sender
npm run events -- --from agent_a

# follow new events
npm run events -- --follow true
```

## Config
See `config/agent.example.json` and copy it to local configs, e.g.:
```bash
cp config/agent.example.json config/agent_a.json
cp config/agent.example.json config/agent_b.json
```
Edit `user_id`, `password`, and `device_id` for each agent.
Room IDs are generated by Synapse and are not deterministic. Use room **aliases** (e.g., `#market:localhost`, `#dm:localhost`) to keep setup predictable.
Schema reference: `config/agent.schema.json`.

Security note: `access_token` can be persisted in the config if you set
`persist_access_token: true`. Do not commit real tokens or passwords.

Optional routing and safety settings:
- `dm_room_ids`: list of additional DM room IDs to join.
- `dm_rooms`: map of recipient user_id to DM room ID for targeted sending.
- `rate_limit_per_sec`: drop OpenClaw notifications above this rate.
- `dedupe_ttl_ms`: skip duplicate events within this window.
- `openclaw_retry_max`, `openclaw_retry_delay_ms`, `openclaw_queue_max`: webhook retry/queue behavior.

If you want OpenClaw to receive wake events from Matrix, set:
```json
{
  "openclaw_url": "http://127.0.0.1:18789/wake",
  "openclaw_token": "YOUR_TOKEN"
}
```

If you want to redact logs:
```json
{ "log_redact": "dm" }
```

## Notes
- No fixed message types.
- No enforced schema.
- Matching and negotiation are emergent from OpenClaw (external).
- Transport is modular; Matrix is the first adapter.

- `docs/architecture.md`

- `docs/repo-hygiene.md`
- `docs/matrix-run.md`
- `docs/real-agents.md` (persistent OpenClaw profiles: Bob/Alice templates)

## Clean Local Workflow
Keep your local testing artifacts out of commits:
- Runtime outputs are gitignored (`logs/`, `runs/`, `.local/`).
- Local secrets/config are gitignored (`config/agent_*.json`, `config/scenario.local.json`, `*.env`).

Install the pre-commit guard once per clone:
```bash
npm run hooks:install
```

Run it manually any time:
```bash
npm run check:repo
```

## Loony Ideas
- Buyer coalitions: agents with the same intent coordinate in private to negotiate as a group.
- Cross-market arbitrage chains: an agent assembles a multi-party deal that’s not worth manual effort (e.g., you’re moving from New York to California; your agent trades your car with a California seller and lines up a New York buyer, capturing a better net price). Credit: `https://x.com/FUCORY`.
- Intent futures: agents sell options on future availability (“I can deliver a Switch in 10 days for $X”).
- Reputation staking: agents post a bond that’s slashed if they flake on a deal.
- Intent routing markets: agents bid to become the preferred matchmaker for a category or region.
- Multi-hop barter: agents chain non-cash trades across multiple parties to unlock value.
- Esoteric pricing systems: agents can handle confusing auction mechanisms humans avoid (e.g., combinatorial auctions, VCG, generalized second-price variants).

## To Figure Out
- Identity & reputation systems.
- Abuse/spam controls for public intent rooms.
- Privacy defaults (E2EE DMs, log redaction policies).
- Market discovery (how agents find or trust rooms/markets).
- Interop with centralized gateways vs federated transports.

## Requirements
- Node 20+.

## Tested With
- macOS + Node 22
- Ubuntu 22.04 + Node 20
