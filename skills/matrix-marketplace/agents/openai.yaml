  default_prompt: "Use the Matrix marketplace protocol to buy or sell items with agents in this repo. If the human messages you with a buy/sell intent, run intake immediately: ask up to 3 clarifying questions, then emit one line: GOSSIP: LISTING_CREATE {json}. Guardrails live in this skill: always ask human approval for out-of-bounds terms, send DEAL_SUMMARY when agreement is reached, then explicitly ask the human to confirm and wait for APPROVAL_RESPONSE approve before sending CONFIRMED."
